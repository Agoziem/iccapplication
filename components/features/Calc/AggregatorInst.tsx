          What is &ldquo;Aggregate Score&rdquo; for University Admissions?
        </h4>
        <p>
          An aggregate score (or cumulative score), is a calculated numerical
          representation of a student’s academic performance and qualifications.
          Universities and colleges use aggregate scores as a key criterion for
          admission to undergraduate programs. The aggregate score takes into
          account various factors, including your secondary school exam results
          (O’levels), your JAMB UTME result, and sometimes additional components
          like post-UTME exams or screening excercise. Since the introduction of
          JAMB CAPS, every school is required to make JAMB score weigh at least
          50% of the total aggregate score of their candidates. The purpose of
          an aggregate score is to provide a holistic assessment of a student’s
          academic abilities and potential. It helps admission committees
          compare applicants fairly and select candidates who are best suited
          for their programs.

          Gather the required Information
        </h4>
        <p>
          Before you can calculate your aggregate score, you need to collect the
          necessary information, which typically includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span className="me-2 fw-bold" style={{ color: "var(--primary)" }}>
              Secondary School Results:
            </span>
            Obtain your final exam results, such as your West African Senior
            School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), Senior Secondary
            Certificate Examination (SSCE), or equivalent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="me-2 fw-bold" style={{ color: "var(--primary)" }}>
              Subject Relevance:
            </span>
            Determine the relevant subjects needed to study your intended
            course. This information is often provided by the university or
            college you’re applying to.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span className="me-2 fw-bold" style={{ color: "var(--primary)" }}>
              Grading System:
            </span>
            Understand the grading system used for your secondary school exams.
            Typically, this includes letter grades (e.g., A, B, C) and
            corresponding grade points (e.g., 10, 9, 8).
          </li>
        </ol>

          O&apos;level Grade Points
        </h4>
        <p>
          Assign grade points to your secondary school exam results based on the
          grading system. For example, for institutions that calculate aggregate
          score without post-UTME.
